# Build phases

Ordered so the licensing gates sit late and isolated. Phases 0–5 deliver a genuinely
usable app with no dependency on either permission landing. Full reasoning in
[SPEC.txt](SPEC.txt).

| # | Phase | Done when | Status |
|---|-------|-----------|--------|
| 0 | Foundations | A test user can sign in on device and the RLS policy denying admin access to reflections has a passing test | **done** |
| 1 | Content pipeline | All three supplied books are in the database with every resolvable reference canonicalised | next |
| 2 | The core loop | A user can complete, break, backfill and repair a streak, and the server agrees with the client | |
| 3 | Offline & sync | A week in airplane mode reconnects to correct state, on a device with a wrong clock | |
| 4 | Library & reflections | Every path to a devotion works and future books are provably invisible | |
| 5 | Admin dashboard | The ministry can author and publish a book without an engineer | |
| 6 | Notifications | Every rung of the ladder fires in a simulated month and the two-per-day cap holds | |
| 7 | Bible reader *(gate 1)* | Every validated cross-reference resolves and opens | |
| 8 | Focus & prayer | DND engages and reliably restores, including on force-kill | |
| 9 | Character & polish *(gate 2)* | No proprietary font remains and Amharic layouts survive the metric change | |
| 10 | Hardening & launch | Both gates cleared in writing, a real cohort has run a full book | |

## Phase 0 — what was built

**Monorepo.** pnpm workspaces: `apps/mobile`, `apps/admin`, `packages/domain`.

**Shared domain types** (`packages/domain`). Branded ids, the bilingual entity types,
the canonical `ScriptureRef` shape, the completion rule as pure testable functions,
and the `RepairRule` interface the streak engine will consume in Phase 2. Rules that
belong to the product rather than to a screen live here so the app, the admin, and
the importer cannot disagree about them.

**Database** (`supabase/migrations`). The full schema — tenancy, content hierarchy,
progress and the append-only streak ledger, and the configuration tables Phases 5–8
will fill in. Every content and progress table carries `church_id` from day one.

Two constraints encode decisions rather than mere hygiene:

- `devotion_days_one_per_date` — a unique index proving the ministry moves together.
- `check (method <> 'backfill' or counted_for_streak = false)` — backfilling can
  never quietly restore a streak, whatever a future caller believes.

**RLS** (`20260830000500_rls.sql`). Own-row-only across all progress tables; content
readable only when published and scheduled on or before today in EAT, which is what
makes future books invisible. Reflections are restricted to their author with **no
admin bypass policy**. Admin engagement numbers come from the `ministry_engagement`
SECURITY DEFINER function, which returns counts and has no column that could carry a
reflection body.

Neither app holds a service-role key, and that is deliberate — one would step over
every policy above.

**Apps.** Expo skeleton with expo-router, a Supabase client wired to AsyncStorage
session persistence, a sign-in/join-code screen, and a Today placeholder that reads
the current day through RLS. Next.js admin skeleton with a browser client. Both are
scaffolding: the real screens are Phases 2–5.

**CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). Typecheck and unit tests on one job; on the
other, a fresh Supabase, the pgTAP suite, and a from-scratch migration replay.

### Verified

- `pnpm typecheck` — clean across all three workspaces.
- `pnpm test` — 7 domain tests pass.
- `pnpm db:test` — 9/9 pgTAP assertions pass, including *"an admin cannot read
  another member's reflection"*.
- Signup → `redeem_join_code` → read `devotion_days`, exercised against the running
  stack: the new member saw exactly the days scheduled on or before today in EAT and
  none of the future ones, and could not read `join_codes` at all.

### Not verified

The exit criterion says *sign in **on device***. The auth path is proven against the
API from this machine, but nobody has run the Expo app on a phone or emulator yet.
That needs Android Studio or a physical device — run `pnpm --filter @abide/mobile
start` and open it in Expo Go to close this out.

### Deferred, deliberately

- **Auth methods** (Q12) stay open. Email + password is the development default, and
  everything provider-specific is confined to `app/sign-in.tsx`.
- **Registration gating** (Q13) is assumed to be a join code, because tenancy has to
  come from somewhere at signup. Swapping it means replacing one function,
  `redeem_join_code`.
- **The iOS Screen Time entitlement** is a Phase 0 item in the spec, but it is a form
  the ministry files, not code. It has not been applied for. It is weeks of lead
  time — start it now.
